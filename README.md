# BS Project - ML Side

This is the **Machine Learning (ML)** module of the BS project.

## Notes:
    âš  Note: The live video feed functionality is not 100% ready yet and may still be buggy.
For demonstration purposes, the system uses two preconfigured license plate images to showcase the detection and OCR capabilities.

## Models Used
- **Haar Cascade**: Used for object detection, particularly for vehicle license plate detection.

## Libraries Used
- **OpenCV**: Handles computer vision operations like image processing and object detection.
- **pytesseract**: Performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images.
- **requests**: Manages HTTP operations for communication with external APIs or services.
